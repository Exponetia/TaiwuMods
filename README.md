# The Scroll of Taiwu  

## Presentation

Fond of the scroll of taiwu, I have almost 800 hours on steam. 
I study in computer science, making mods is also an opportunity to learn the practice. 
Glad if my mods please you. 

## Mod preference 

I like mods that does not break the balance of the game, since a lot of fun lives in the optimization of combat skill.  

## Technical constraint

For the moment, I can only make mods that does not involve the frontend.  
I could not use the workshop tool and I have contacted the dev team ( without any answer )  

Hope the developement of the official workshop tools will become better and better.
